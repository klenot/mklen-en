# Welcome to my personal website üëãüèª

I started this project to learn more about the technical side of creating web applications. What began as a basic HTML and CSS project ended up as a Next.js site using Notion as its CMS.

It is also worth mentioning that the inspiration for this project came from a really cool service called super.so, which I had used before creating the new site.

## Why Notion?
I find using Notion really convenient. I also use Notion with many integrations that help me unify my system into one productivity center. Using Notion to control the site content is a big time-saver for me.

## Project Specifications
- **Framework:** Next.js 14
- **CMS:** Notion.so
- **Forms:** Formsubmit.io
- **Analytics:** Umami.is


## Do you need help?
I do not consider myself as someone experienced in web development. That might be an opportunity for somebody who started similarly, without any previous knowledge and just went for it. **If you have any questions regarding this project, hit me up** at klenoticmarek@gmail.com; I'll do my best to answer your questions.
