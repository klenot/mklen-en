# Welcome to my personal website 👋🏻

I started this project to learn more about the technical side of creating web applications. What began as a basic HTML and CSS project ended up as a Next.js site using Notion as its CMS.

## Why Notion?
I find using Notion really convenient. I also use Notion with many integrations that help me unify my system into one productivity center. Using Notion to control the site content is a big time-saver for me.

## Do you need help?
I do not consider myself as someone experienced in web development. That might be an opportunity for somebody who started similarly, without any previous knowledge and just went for it. **If you have any questions regarding this project, hit me up** at klenoticmarek@gmail.com; I'll do my best to answer your questions.
